## Introduction

fuzzy is a Go package that brings the power of fuzzy matching to your applications. It analyzes a list of strings (typically representing lines, filenames, or commands) and returns the best matches along with a scoreâ€”lower scores indicate a better match. With a design that balances simplicity and performance, fuzzy is suitable even for very large datasets! ðŸš€

## Features

* Smart Fuzzy Search:

    Quickly search through a slice of strings and obtain scores that reflect how closely each string matches your query.
* Levenshtein Distance Option:

    When you need a more forgiving search (especially useful when handling typos), leverage the Levenshtein-based search ensuring at least 60% of the query is present.
* Customizable Query Filtering:

    Enhance your query with filters directly within the query string:
    * `*filter` â€“ requires the source to contain the filter.
    * `$filter` â€“ requires the source to end with the filter.
    * `^filter` â€“ requires the source to start with the filter.
* Flexible Sorting:

    Use SortMatches to arrange results first by match score and then by the position within the source.
