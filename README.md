# fuzzy

Welcome to fuzzy â€“ a Go package designed to perform fuzzy searches in slices of strings, assigning a score to each match based on how well it fits. With fuzzy, you can quickly and intelligently search through collections of text, making it perfect for command-line tools, text editors, or any application that requires fast and flexible string matching. ðŸ˜Š

## Introduction

fuzzy is a Go package that brings the power of fuzzy matching to your applications. It analyzes a list of strings (typically representing lines, filenames, or commands) and returns the best matches along with a scoreâ€”lower scores indicate a better match. With a design that balances simplicity and performance, fuzzy is suitable even for very large datasets! ðŸš€

## Features

* **Smart Fuzzy Search:**

    Quickly search through a slice of strings and obtain scores that reflect how closely each string matches your query.
* **Levenshtein Distance Option:**

    When you need a more forgiving search (especially useful when handling typos), leverage the Levenshtein-based search ensuring at least 60% of the query is present.
* **Customizable Query Filtering:**

    Enhance your query with filters directly within the query string:
    * `*filter` â€“ requires the source to contain the filter.
    * `$filter` â€“ requires the source to end with the filter.
    * `^filter` â€“ requires the source to start with the filter.
* **Flexible Sorting:**

    Use SortMatches to arrange results first by match score and then by the position within the source.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/Tagliapietra96/fuzzy
